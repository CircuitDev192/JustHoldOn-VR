# JustHoldOn-VR
 A VR adaptation of the Just Hold On and Epicenter IPs

Game is playable from start to finish. Main menu and ending scene are placeholders.
To start the game, pick up the pistol with one hand, load the magazine using the other, pull back the slide, and press B to disengage the safety. Then, pull the trigger to shoot the cube in front of you. If you do this correctly, you will immediately teleport to a loading scene.
