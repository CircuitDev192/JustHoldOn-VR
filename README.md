# JustHoldOn-VR
 A VR adaptation of the Just Hold On and Epicenter IPs

Game is playable from start to finish. Main menu and ending scene are placeholders.
To start the game, pick up the pistol with one hand, load the magazine using the other, pull back the slide, and press B to disengage the safety. Then, pull the trigger to shoot the cube in front of you. If you do this correctly, you will immediately teleport to a loading scene.

To start the game, run the .exe, and make sure you have SteamVR installed and (preferably) running already. When the Main Menu scene loads, you will see a pistol, magazine, and some boxes in the air. Grab the pistol, load the magazine into it, rack the slide back, and press B/Y to turn off the safety. Shoot the menu item you would like to select. There are no confirmations in the latest build, so make sure you want to do whatever you choose. Shoot "Start Game" to begin. You will see a loading scene next, which has no interaction to mention, other than the ability to the pickup the "Loading" tablet. 
After the main game loads, look around. You'll see an NPC with "Over here!" above his head. This is the Mission Giver. It's his job to give you the mission info, and allow you to progress. Walk up to him to speak to him. Stay close, as he will provide the mission info as text displayed infront of him. After receiving the mission info, you can look to the left of the Mission Giver and see an ammo box with items on top. It is expected that you will carry (almost) all of theses items every time you leave the spawn area, but this is not necessary. Every item can be picked up by using the grip button. Start by taking a look at the tablet. 

This is your PDA, and will guide you toward your mission objectives, tell you what the current mission is, and show you your current health status. The yellow arrow points straight up on the PDA when you are facing the objective. The health bar will update any time you take damage. But be careful, there are no health packs to be found. The last survivors needed all the medical supplies they could find. If you do die however, the game will restart at the end of the last mission you played. So if you finish mission 1, and return to the police station, your game will save there, and you can even close the game and load that save later! No need to worry about losing your mission progress. 

------------

Every item has a place in your inventory. 

Katana - Right Shoulder

M1911 Pistol - Right Hip

M4 Rifle - Right Chest

Pistol and Rifle Mags - Left Chest, in any of the 4 mag slots

Grenades - Left Chest, between, and further out from the mag slots

PDA - Left Hip

Flashlight - Left Shoulder

All inventory slots have a radius around them at which you can let go of the item you are holding, and the item will automatically go into the slot. The katana has the most generous radius, too allow more easily holstering/unholstering, since its on the back/shoulder and harder to see as you put it away. 

------------

The M4 Rifle has two sights, an iron sight and a combination red dot and magnified night vision scope. Both can be useful depending on the situation. Feel free to try both. To attach any attachment to any weapon, pick up the attachment with the grip button, and move it over the weapon. If the weapon can accept that attachment, it will automatically be attached. To remove an attachment, just grab it like you would any item. 

The M4 Rifle is also two handed, so don't forget to stabilize your shots by holding the foregrip/rail too!

The Suppressor attachment will make your shots quieter, and thus making it much harder for the zombies to hear you. Use this wisely. It can also go on both guns!

The foregrip attachment can be put on the M4, however, it is not possible to grab it at this time. If you want the look though, you can still attach the foregrip, then just hold the M4's rail like normal. 

To use the Tactical Flashlight attachment, pick it up, and then use the trigger to turn it on and off. Place it on the M4 and it will keep whatever setting you chose. Remove it, then use the trigger again to edit the setting. (You can not turn the light on/off while it is on the gun at this time)

The Standard HandHeld Flashlight is used the same way, press trigger to turn it on and off. However, pressing B/Y will also allow you to flip the flashlight around, to allow for whichever grip you prefer. 

Both lights are extremely effective at detering the zombies. Shine the light in their face to scare them away in a pinch. The same is true for all lights in the world. 

There are 3 cubes on the left side of the ammo box. Use the trigger on each to spawn magazines and grenades.

Grenades can be used to lure zombies via the loud sound, and of course to kill them in large groups. To use the grenade, pick it up with one hand, then use the trigger on the other hand to pull the pin. If you do this by mistake, don't worry! You can put the pin back into the grenade so long as you don't let go of it first. Pressing A/X will also let you cook the grenade before throwing. But be careful, you only have a few seconds!

The small cube on the right of the ammo box is to manually respawn any items you may have lost. This shouldn't be necessary though, as every 15 seconds, any item you don't have in your inventory will be respawned automatically, so long as it isn't already near the ammo box!

Now that you have a mission and your gear, walk through the main gate of the police station. When you do this, notice how the PDA updates to show the current mission, and the compass begins pointing toward the objective location. Travel to the objective, but be careful, it's dangerous out there, and the zombies are ruthless. When you get to the objective area for each mission, find whatever item you need to bring back to the police station, and stand near it until it disappears. When this happens, you have "collected" the item and can return to base. Check the PDA for this updated info, as well as a compass heading that will take you back to the police station's main gate.

------------

Missions 1-3 are the same fetch quest formula, but mission 4 requires you to get rid of a certain number of zombies in the area. When you do this, think about how you might also be able to lure the zombies away. Regardless of how you complete this mission, watch for the PDA to update after enough zombies have been removed from the area. For mission 5, it's important to take note of the Browning M2 Mounted Heavy Machine Gun nearby. If you aren't on mission 5 yet, you can still give the M2 HMG a test run. But for this final mission, you'll need it for sure. 

The ending scene after mission 5 isn't designed to kill you, or be too much of a hassle. It should be fairly straightforward, and if you die, that wasn't supposed to happen! Once that scene is over, you'll be put into the credits scene, which showcases all the assets I used to make Epicenter VR. When you're ready, grab the tablet at the far end of the area (closer to the "Thanks for playing!" message). This will load up the Main Menu, allowing you to return to the game, or quit. Don't forget that the mission progress was saved after mission 4, so if you want to play the game again, you'll need to shoot the "Reset Progress" menu option first!

Speaking of quitting, there is no way to close the game other than the Main Menu right now, so feel free to force close the game through the SteamVR menu instead. A bit jank, but it wasn't exactly a priority during development!

That should be everything. If you have any questions you can email me at CircuitDev192@gmail.com. I would love to hear any feedback on the game that you may have.
